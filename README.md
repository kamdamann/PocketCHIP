# What is PocketCHIP?
PocketCHIP was born out of the success of the CHIP, a single-board computer that was initially crowdfunded on Kickstarter in 2015. The CHIP was marketed as the world's first $9 computer, featuring a 1GHz ARMv7 processor, 512MB of RAM, and 4GB of flash storage:

Building on the success of the CHIP, Next Thing Co. introduced the PocketCHIP, a handheld version with a built-in keyboard and touchscreen display. The PocketCHIP includes a 1GHz ARM CPU, 4GB of flash storage, 512MB of RAM, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a 4.3-inch touchscreen display

Despite its initial success, Next Thing Co. faced financial difficulties and eventually went insolvent in 2018. As a result, the PocketCHIP and other products were discontinued.

Although PocketCHIP is no longer available, it remains a beloved device among those who used it for various projects. Its affordability and open-source nature made it a valuable tool for learning and experimentation in the world of electronics and programming.
